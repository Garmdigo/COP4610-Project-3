# COP4610-Project-3
Diego Gutierrez, Samuel Parmer, Christian Gazmuri <br/>
Instructions:<br/>
To compile, type "make" in the project directory. The image file can be specified 2 ways, either providing a path or placing it in the executable directory. For the first method, run the executable with the path to the FAT32 image file as the aurgument. It takes argv[1] so it can find the file. For the 2nd method, simply put the FAT32 image file in the same directory as the executable and run. The default parameter is fat32.img. If the name of the file is not FAT32, use the first method.
